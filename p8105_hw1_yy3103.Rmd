# Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

q1=tibble(samp = rnorm(10),
          samp > 10,
          cvec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
          fvec = factor(c("red","green","yellow","red","red","green","red","red","red","red")))

print(q1)
```

The mean are as following:
```{r}
mean(pull(q1,samp))
mean(as.numeric(pull(q1,cvec)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(q1,fvec)))
```

# Problem 2
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```
There are 8 variables:"species","island","bill_length_mm","bill_depth_mm"   , "flipper_length_mm","body_mass_g","sex", "year". There are 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper length is 200.92.
```{r}
colnames(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm=TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm,color=species)) + geom_point()
